# EnergyConsumption-Equation

For a WSN with nodes equidistantly and linearly placed, the power used to transmit data must be inversely proportional to the85 number of hops n, added to a constant power used in the data reception and processing. Therefore, the energy consumption may be calculated by equation given by

E = log(n) × p × t + Gr + Gp × t × n

in witch E c is the energy consumed to transmit one packet, n is the number of hops, log(n) × p is the energy transmission power proportional to n, t is the transmission time, and Gr and Gp are the required power to receive and process packet data, respectively.
